    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This project aimed to revamp an existing website dedicated to combating Youth Homelessness. The primary objective was to redesign and enhance the website for A Way Home, focusing on promoting volunteering opportunities. By doing so, the goal was to engage more users and encourage their participation in efforts to reduce the population of homeless youths in Canada.</p>

    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>Through user interviews, we uncovered individuals' challenges in finding avenues to support at-risk youth and their desire to gain deeper insights into their struggles. As a result, there is a genuine interest in learning and assisting, and we can make a difference by facilitating volunteering, donations, and education. One approach to achieve this is redesigning and iteratively enhancing the A Way Home website, making these initiatives more accessible to everyone involved..</p>

<!-- Problem Statement Section -->
<section id="problem-statement" class="container mt-4">
    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Based on our user interviews, we have noticed that users are unaware of the issues of at-risk youth and donâ€™t know how to fight against this problem. This lack of awareness hinders their ability to assist, limiting the support available to homeless youth who could greatly benefit from it.</p>

    <h2>Iteration</h2>
    <p>Based on user feedback, we addressed two key design aspects in the redesign. Firstly, users desired more colour, as they felt the previous design lacked vibrancy. To address this, we incorporated a broader colour palette throughout the website to make it visually engaging and appealing.
Secondly, users mentioned excessive white space, which affected the overall design balance. We rounded the images and resource blocks to create a more welcoming and cozy atmosphere. </p>

<p>Based on user feedback, we made significant adjustments to improve the flow and accessibility of information on the website. Users expressed that the previous jigsaw/jagged flow was overwhelming and confusing. To address this, we restructured the content to create a more cohesive and seamless flow, making it easier for users to navigate and comprehend the information.
Furthermore, users indicated that finding relevant resources was challenging, mainly when they needed more time and couldn't read entire paragraphs. In response, we added yellow resource buttons to highlight and make the hyperlink to relevant resources more prominent. This enhancement ensures that users can quickly locate and access the needed resources without extensively searching the content.</p>

    <h2>Prototype</h2>
    <p>Redesigning the A Way Home website presents an exciting opportunity to address the issue of youth homelessness and foster greater community engagement. Through user interviews, we have identified the challenges faced by individuals who are eager to contribute but struggle to find effective ways to help and understand the struggles of at-risk youth. Through iterative improvements and a user-centred approach, we are confident that the redesigned website will catalyze positive change and be a hub for fostering connections and understanding within the community.</p>
